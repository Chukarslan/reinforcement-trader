# reinforcement-trader (WIP)

v0.0.1 (at some point I need to use Sphinx for version control, maybe not for a simple script)

At some point I also will provide an option to switch between reinforcement (PPO) agent (much more reactive) to a packaged LSTM model (like Xception - much more stable) to see which one is better :)

NB / NFA: If you are randmoly searching GitHub for the "magic potion" of trading this is *NOT IT*. I take NO RESPONSIBILITY for any application of this script in your trades, this is purely to test the capabilities of PPO and Xception models against one another.
